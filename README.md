# 🎮 Avital Palchik — Interactive Portfolio

This is my personal portfolio website built with **Next.js, React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS**, featuring **two distinct experiences**:

- 🧑‍💻 **Website Mode** — a clean, professional portfolio
- 🕹️ **Gamified Mode** — an interactive, pixel-style world with journals, collectibles, and hidden content

The project combines strong frontend engineering with playful, exploratory design to create a memorable portfolio experience.
